For this project:
1. Get Api from Open Weather
2. Build a weather dashboard that displays a city's current weather & five day forecast
3. Use local storage to set/get cities in the ul list
4. Click on past searches to display weather


Issues I have encountered:
1. The five day forecast was displaying 40 items now it's not displaying. I broke it with one of my pushes. Was trying to compare in past commits but was unable to find the issue.
