For this project:
1. Get Api from Open Weather
2. Build a weather dashboard that displays a city's current weather & five day forecast
3. Use local storage to set/get cities in the ul list
4. Click on past searches to display weather


Issues I encountered and don't believe should be marked down:
1. The five day forecast was displaying 40 items - the professor never went over how to grab a certain time and use it to limit the amount of days. Yes I know it needs to be a for loop & an if statement, but how? My tutuor was stumped and the way she was trying to explain it to me we weren't taught in the course.
2. The five day forecast isn't displaying anymore. I don't know what I did to break it in my last commit but in previous commits you'll see that it was working. 
3. Not enough time to work on this project - we were told not to work on it early so that gave us two days - really just one day since half of the day is spent in class. 
4. I don't want to fail this course. I know I am close to fixing this so it works, but I don't have enough time to make it work since it is due in less than an hour. 
5. Yes I know this comes across unprofessional but these are the difficulties I was facing with this project.
